CAT824 JS Renderer
==================

Javascript + THREEjs frontend to Sunflow renderer

You will need...

Node and Sunflow up and running, then update the path to sunflow.jar in /routes/apis/render.js

The chances are you're _not_ going to get both Node and Sunflow up and running but this _may_ be useful for people searching for things being written in THREE.js that have loads of comments throughout the .js (which you'll find in /public/js/control.js)
